# 🖭 MixTape HeavyWeight 🥊

**MixTape HeavyWeight** is a feature-rich web app built for streaming and downloading DJ mixes. The intuitive user interface incorporates skeuomorphic design elements reminiscent of a hi-fi stacking system and classic old-school mixtapes. An array of features include an audio visualizer, a skippable playlist (allowing you to click through multiple tracks despite only loading a single audio file), and a comments section (which doesn't interrupt playback). As the mix plays, the tracklisting updates automatically, so the listener knows at a glance which song the DJ is spinning!
