# üñ≠ MixTape HeavyWeight ü§º on Digital Ocean üåäü™∏üêöüê¨

ssh into the Digital Ocean box:

`dobox`

or

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/digiocean root@139.59.161.31
```

## Update Files

```bash
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/digiocean" ftp/ root@139.59.161.31:/var/www/mthw
```

**rsync** is an efficient tool for synchronizing files between your local machine and the VM. It‚Äôs particularly useful if you regularly update files, as it only copies the differences, making the process faster.

- a: Archive mode (preserves permissions, symlinks, etc.)
- v: Verbose (shows the transfer process)
- z: Compresses files during transfer for faster copying

## üëÄ Point Your Domain to the Droplet‚Äôs IP Address

- On the Namecheap dashboard, click on Domain List from the left-hand menu.
- Find the domain and click Manage next to it.
- In the Domain tab, click on the Advanced DNS tab.
- Scroll to the Host Records section.
- Add or update the following records:

1. **A Record for the root domain (@)**:

- Host: @
- Value: Your Droplet's IP address
- TTL: Leave it as Automatic or set it to a low value like 300 seconds for faster propagation.

2. **A Record for www**:

- Host: www
- Value: Your Droplet's IP address
- TTL: Leave it as Automatic or set it to a low value like 300 seconds for faster propagation.

Click the green checkmark or Save All Changes.

It might take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours for the DNS changes to propagate worldwide, but it's often quite fast. You can use a tool like [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/#A/mixtape-heavyweight.one) to see if the domain is resolving to the correct IP address, or verify that the DNS record has been updated by running the following command:

```bash
nslookup mixtape-heavyweight.one
```

This should return the public IP address of your VM.

## PHP-FPM Configuration

Run this command to list installed PHP modules:

bash
Copy code
php -m

## üìú Certbot: SSL Certificates üëë

Use Certbot to generate an SSL certificate for your domain.

Install Certbot:

```bash
apt install python3-certbot-nginx
```

Automatically configure the SSL settings in your Nginx configuration:

```bash
certbot --nginx
```

or more verbose:

```bash
certbot --nginx -d mixtape-heavyweight.one -d www.mixtape-heavyweight.one
```

Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days, but Certbot can automate the renewal process. The command below can be used to manually test renewal:

```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag is a test to simulate the renewal process without actually renewing the certificate. It's useful to check if the renewal will work without issues. You typically run `--dry-run` after initial setup or when you're debugging a renewal issue, but not every time you get an expiry warning.

### Automated Renewal Process

Certbot, by default, installs a cron job or systemd timer that automatically checks for certificate renewals twice a day. You can check for the presence of these tasks:

```bash
systemctl list-timers | grep certbot
```

If your certificate is due to expire (within 30 days), Certbot will automatically attempt to renew it.

### What to Do When You Get an Expiry Email

Nothing, if Certbot is working properly: Certbot should automatically renew your certificate before it expires, so no action is needed.

If you're concerned: You can manually trigger the renewal by running:

```bash
sudo certbot renew
```

## Speed Up Your Server

When PHP-FPM is set to spawn new workers on demand, the first request can take longer because it has to spin up workers. To address this:

Increase PHP-FPM pool settings in /etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf:

pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 10 # Increase if the server has enough resources
pm.start_servers = 3 # Start more servers to avoid cold starts
pm.min_spare_servers = 2 # Ensure a minimum number of idle workers
pm.max_spare_servers = 5

This configuration ensures that enough PHP-FPM workers are already running when the first request hits.

# Audio Files on AWS S3 üéµ

## Configure the S3 bucket to serve audio files publicly

Step 1: Unblock Public Access

- Select your S3 bucket.
- Go to the Permissions tab.
- Edit the "Block Public Access" settings:
- Uncheck "Block all public access".
- Confirm the change by clicking Save.

Step 2: Add a Bucket Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::followcrom-online/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Step 3: Add or Modify the CORS Configuration

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://mixtape.followcrom.online"],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "Content-Length",
      "Content-Type",
      "ETag",
      "Content-Range"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

Step 4: Make the audio files downloadable

You can set the `Content-Disposition` header to `attachment `in your S3 bucket settings. This header can force the browser to download the file instead of displaying it.

In an object's properties window, click the `metadata` tab. Generally, **Key** is by default set to **Content-Type** and **Value** is set to **audio/mp3**.

Click the `Add more metadata` button, and add:

`Key: Content-Disposition Value: attachment`

Save the changes.

In the HTML page, try:

```html
<a
  href="https://mthw.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/db/original.mp3"
  download="original.mp3"
  type="audio/mpeg"
>
  <button class="action-btn action-btn-big">
    <i class="fas fa-download"></i>
  </button>
</a>
```

or

```html
<a
  href="https://mthw.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/db/original.mp3?response-content-disposition=attachment; filename=original.mp3"
>
  <button class="action-btn action-btn-big">
    <i class="fas fa-download"></i>
  </button>
</a>
```

## Update the HTML

Ensure the streaming audio tag looks like this:

```html
<audio id="audio" preload="none" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source
    src="https://mthw.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gf/supafly.mp3"
    type="audio/mpeg"
  />
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
```

- The `crossorigin attribute` ensures consistent behavior across different browsers and scenarios. It explicitly tells the browser to make a CORS request, which can prevent certain types of attacks and unintended behavior.

- Use the Object URL as the source for the audio file (`https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/your-file.mp3`). This is a publicly accessible HTTP(S) URL that you can use directly in web browsers or embed in web pages, and is ideal for streaming or linking to files from websites.

- The S3 URI (e.g. `s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/your-file.mp3`) is mainly used within AWS services, SDKs, and CLI for referencing objects in S3 and is not directly usable in a web browser or for embedding in web pages.

## Debugging

**Use curl** to test your S3 endpoint directly. This can help determine if it's a server-side or client-side issue:

```bash
curl -I -H "Origin: https://mixtape.followcrom.online" https://mthw.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gf/supafly.mp3
```

This should return headers including Access-Control-Allow-Origin if CORS is correctly configured.

**Network Tab:** In the browser's developer tools, go to the Network tab, filter for your MP3 file, and examine the request and response headers in detail. Look for any discrepancies with the curl results.

**Browser Cache:** Perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 on Windows) to ensure you're not seeing cached results.
